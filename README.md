# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [npm create vite@latest](https://vitejs.dev/guide).

## Available Scripts

In the client project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the front-end app in the development mode.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

In the client folder, replace any link having localhost with you back-end sever's link.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.

In the server project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the back-end app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

Don't forget to configure your mongodb properly in the file index.js.

Head to the folder routes, open the file openai.js and configure your api key. Still in the folder routes, open the file postRoutes.js and configure your cloudinary credentials.
